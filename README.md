# ðŸŽ® Bubble Game

Welcome to the Bubble Game! This project is a fun web game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you'll see the basics of building a web game while exploring cool JavaScript tricks like event bubbling and DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Event Bubbling**: Experience the magic of event bubbling! It allows us to trigger actions when certain elements are clicked, making things pop in the game.
  
- **DOM Manipulation**: Look how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change elements on webpage dynamically. In this game, we'll be using DOM tricks to tweak the game mechanics and appearance.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the bubbles as they appear on the screen to pop them.
3. Enjoy the satisfying popping sound effects and keep track of your score!

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

- **Event Bubbling**: By leveraging event bubbling, we can efficiently handle click events on multiple bubbles without attaching individual event listeners to each one.
  
- **DOM Manipulation**: We use DOM manipulation techniques to update the game state, such as increasing the score when a bubble is popped and removing popped bubbles from the DOM.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improving the game or want to fix a bug, feel free to submit a pull request.
